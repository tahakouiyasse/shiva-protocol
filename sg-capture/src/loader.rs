//! `loader.rs` — eBPF object loading and XDP program attachment.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//! 1. Load the pre-compiled `sg-ebpf` ELF object from disk.
//! 2. Attempt XDP attachment in `DRV_MODE` (native hardware offload).
//!    Fall back to `SKB_MODE` (generic/software) if the NIC driver does not
//!    support native XDP — this is transparent to the rest of the pipeline.
//! 3. Open all NCPU per-CPU ring buffer map handles and return them as a
//!    `Vec<Option<RingBuf<MapData>>>` so that `main.rs` can consume handles
//!    by index without fighting a borrow conflict on a wrapper table type.
//! 4. On graceful shutdown, detach the XDP hook and restore the interface.
//!
//! # Error discipline
//! Every fallible call uses `anyhow::Context` (mandated by §Mandate) so that
//! the error chain always identifies *which* operation failed and *why*, without
//! `Box<dyn Error>` erasure on the critical init path.
//!
//! # Change from previous revision
//! `load_and_attach` previously returned `(LoadedProbe, PerCpuRingTable)`.
//! It now returns `(LoadedProbe, Vec<Option<RingBuf<MapData>>>)` so that
//! `main.rs` can consume handles with `.into_iter().enumerate()` without the
//! borrow-checker conflict that caused the silent zero-worker defect.
//! `PerCpuRingTable` is no longer required by the loader; it may be retained
//! elsewhere as a utility type if needed by future consumers.
