//! `metrics.rs` — Lock-free telemetry counters for the vacuum pipeline.
//!
//! # Design constraints (CONTROLLER.md §3, INV-01)
//! * All counters are `AtomicU64` — no `Mutex`, no heap allocation on update.
//! * The reporting thread reads counters with `Relaxed` ordering (same-thread
//!   monotonicity is sufficient for a 1-second telemetry window).
//! * Drop-rate calculation uses integer-only arithmetic — no floating point in
//!   the hot path, no `f64` division that could generate NaN in edge cases.
//! * The reporter is a single dedicated `std::thread` (not a Tokio task) so
//!   that it does not compete with the async executor or the vacuum threads.
